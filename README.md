# Simulation of a Manufacturing Facility

This project focuses on the creation of a manufacturing facility simulation where three distinct products are produced. Each product follows a unique production path through various workstations and requires specific components.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Model Verification and Validation:** The simulation model undergoes thorough verification and validation processes to ensure its accuracy and reliability in replicating real-world manufacturing processes.

- **Production Runs and Analysis:** Multiple production runs are conducted using the simulation model, generating valuable data. Comprehensive analysis of these runs provides insights into the facility's performance, efficiency, and potential bottlenecks.

- **Alternative Operating Policy Proposal:** Based on the analysis results, an alternative operating policy is proposed to optimize the manufacturing facility's operations and improve overall productivity.

## Project Deliverables

The final project deliverable includes a comprehensive report and the source code for the simulation. The [project deliverable report](https://github.com/Azizkhaled/SIMULATION-OF-A-MANUFACTURING-FACILITY/blob/main/4th%20project%20deliverabe%20SYSC%205001_Aziz_Al-Najjar%20.pdf) contains the following components:

1. **Simulation Model Details:** A detailed explanation of the simulation model's architecture, components, and how it mimics the manufacturing process.

2. **Verification and Validation:** An account of the verification and validation procedures performed to establish the credibility of the simulation.

3. **Production Run Results:** Presentation and analysis of data collected from multiple production runs, highlighting key performance indicators and trends.

4. **Alternative Operating Policy:** Proposal of an alternative operating policy, supported by insights from the analysis, to enhance the facility's efficiency.

5. **Source Code:** The source code used to build and execute the simulation, enabling transparency and reproducibility.
